//Duval Le Blanc - 07/24/24
//The Odin Project Lab - Creating first Index File (boilerplate)

//Notes - Naming an .html file web servers will look for this file by default
// when users land on our websites, not having one will cause big problems

//Every HTML Starts with a DOCTYPE Declaration. The doctype's purpose is to
// let the Browser know what version of HTML it should user to render the document



//HTML5 Delcatation
<!DOCTYPE html>


//Root Element "html" - All elements will be contained within this element 
//"lang" element is used to specify the language of text in the that specific element
<html lang="en">


// "head" element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages and things required for to render in the browser
// in the "head" we SHOULD NOT use any element that displays content on the webpage 
<head>

    //setting the encoding is important because it is what will render special characters from different languages correctly
    <meta charset="utf-8">

        //"title" element should always be in the "head" element of the html file, this will output readable text to user on top
        <title> First Web Page </title>


</head>
            //The "body" element is the last element of the html boilerplate and is ALWAYS below the "head" element
            <body>
                This is the body of your first web page. This completes the html boilerplate lab 

            </body>



</html>
//Root Element Closure
