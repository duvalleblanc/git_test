Hello Odin!
Testing Repository for TOP Lab 

//Duval Le Blanc - 07/24/24
//The Odin Project Lab - Creating first Index File (boilerplate)

//Notes - Naming an .html file web servers will look for this file by default
// when users land on our websites, not having one will cause big problems

//Every HTML Starts with a DOCTYPE Declaration. The doctype's purpose is to
// let the Browser know what version of HTML it should user to render the document


//Root Element "html" - All elements will be contained within this element 
//"lang" element is used to specify the language of text in the that specific element

// "head" element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages and things required for to render in the browser
// in the "head" we SHOULD NOT use any element that displays content on the webpage 

//setting the encoding is important because it is what will render special characters from different languages correctly

 //"title" element should always be in the "head" element of the html file, this will output readable text to user on top

 //The "body" element is the last element of the html boilerplate and is ALWAYS below the "head" element

  This is the body of your first web page. This completes the html boilerplate lab 

  //Root Element Closure
